## 🔧 **CONFIGURATION**

The application is **ready to use** with the following default settings:

### **In `main.py`:**
```python
# Enhanced pages are enabled by default
self.use_enhanced_pages = True  # Set to False to use original pages
```

### **Performance Settings:**
- **Page Size**: 50 items per page (configurable)
- **Search Debounce**: 300ms delay (configurable)
- **UI Freeze Threshold**: 100ms (configurable)
- **Background Task Timeout**: 30 seconds (configurable)

---

## 🎯 **HOW TO USE**

### **Immediate Use**
1. **Run the application**: `python main.py`
2. **Enhanced pages load automatically** with improved performance
3. **Large datasets are paginated** to prevent UI freezing
4. **Progress dialogs show** during long operations
5. **Performance metrics are logged** automatically

### **Monitoring Performance**
1. **Check logs** in `logs/application.log` for performance metrics
2. **Use analysis tools** in `tools/` directory for detailed reports
3. **Monitor real-time** performance through the integrated monitoring system

### **Customization**
1. **Adjust pagination size** in enhanced data access module
2. **Modify search debounce timing** in UI components
3. **Configure performance thresholds** in performance monitor
4. **Switch to standard pages** by setting `use_enhanced_pages = False`
