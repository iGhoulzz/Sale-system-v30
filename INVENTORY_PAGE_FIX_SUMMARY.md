# Enhanced Inventory Page - Comprehensive Fix Summary

## Date: July 18, 2025

## 🎯 **PROBLEM ANALYSIS**

The Enhanced Inventory Page had multiple critical issues:

1. **Search Error**: `_perform_product_search()` method didn't accept `limit` parameter but FastSearchEntry tried to pass it
2. **Poor UI Visibility**: Black fonts on dark backgrounds made text unreadable
3. **Missing Categories Section**: No proper category management interface
4. **Missing CRUD Operations**: Add, Edit, Delete functionality was incomplete or missing
5. **No Loss Tracking**: Missing product loss recording functionality
6. **Poor Font Styling**: Text was hard to read due to styling issues
7. **Navigation Issues**: References to non-existent frames like "StartPage"
